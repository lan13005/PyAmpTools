    "# Motivation\n",
    "- Partial wave analysis can be complicated (fitting, bookkeeping, result handling, ...)\n",
    "- PyAmpTools sacrifices flexibility for ease of use and focuses on Python as the core language\n",
    "- **Features:**\n",
    "    - Scientific Python ecosystem is massive (achieve most of the benefits of low level languages without the hassle)\n",
    "    - Optimization uses gradients provided by JAX automatic differentiation (scales better than numerical diff.)\n",
    "    - Hooks into several optimization frameworks spanning MLE, MCMC, to Variational Inference\n",
    "        - iminuit, scipy, numpyro, iftpwa\n",
    "    - YAML file is used to configure the analysis for consistency and automation\n",
    "    - Fitting is generally done through the command line"

    "\n",
    "The following analysis chain is an example of an **input/output** study. If you have data then you can skip you basically skip the first two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We draw a sample from the nifty prior distribution\n",
    "2. generate simulations (using `gen_amp` + `halld_sim/Piecewise` amplitude mimicking prior sample)\n",
    "3. bin the data\n",
    "4. fit the simulated data using:\n",
    "    - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n",
    "    - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "    - Information Field Theory (IFT)\n",
    "5. plot the results\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to show a high probability of reconstruction. If this occurs for a wide variety of samples (and we believe our data could be approximately described by the very-flexible nifty prior) then we have successfully demonstrated that inference would be robust."
