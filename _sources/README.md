Documentation is powered by jupyter-book (a distribution of sphinx). A makefile is prepared to build and clean the documentation and push the changes to github pages.

`make clean`  - clean generated HTML files

`make build`  - run jupyter-book

`make push`   - push to github pages

`make update` - build and push

`make rebuild` - clean first then update
