# Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics in the low energy regime is poorly understood. Gluon rich systems, like hybrid mesons, are predicted by theory but experimental idenficiation of these states have been difficult. The light meson spectrum contains many overlapping states that require partial wave (amplitude) analysis to disentangle. AmpTools is a library written in c++ that facilitates performing unbinned maximum likelihood fits of experimental data to a coherent sum of amplitudes. 

This repository contains Python bindings for [AmpTools](https://github.com/mashephe/AmpTools). Under the hood, it uses [PyROOT](https://root.cern/manual/python/) which uses cppyy. These bindings will hopefully simplify the interaction with the AmpTools library while also providing access to the python ecosystem. [FSRoot](https://github.com/remitche66/FSRoot) is also included as a submodule and can be integrated into analysis workflows.
