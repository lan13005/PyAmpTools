    "Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is another class of techniques to perform interence by sampling directly from the posterior distribution. In this tutorial we will showcase how to use [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an *ensemble sampler*. Ensemble samplers uses a set of walkers that move around the parameter space generally spending more time in high probablity regions. Several types of moves are implemented in `emcee` and can be mixed together to form a probabilistic mixture, see [emcee moves documentation](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/moves/). Accepting or rejecting the move is based on the [Metropolis algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm). "
