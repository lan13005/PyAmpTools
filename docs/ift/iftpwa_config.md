# iftpwa - Default Configuration

## Correlated Field Model in NIFTy
Please read the following first, perhaps run the code yourself to see how the correlated field model works in NIFTy. This model forms the basis of the iftpwa package.
[Showcasing the Correlated Field Model (NIFTy)](https://ift.pages.mpcdf.de/nifty/user/old_nifty_getting_started_4_CorrelatedFields.html)

```{note}
The correlated field model is no longer a Gaussian process but it does make understanding and explaining the IFT approach easier
```

## Simplified Model

The following simplified amplitude description is used to depict how the configuration file key-value fields affect the model for each amplitude. The first term in the brackets describes a non-parameteric component which can be adept at describing unknown background contributions. The second term describes a parameteric component which we generally have a physical description for (i.e. Breit-Wigner, Flatt√©, ...)

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_i(m, t) = \kappa \cdot \rho_i \cdot C_i \cdot \Big[ 
    & S_b \cdot G(m \mid s_{m,i},\; f_{m,i},\; a_{m,i}) \cdot G(t \mid s_{t,i},\; f_{t,i},\; a_{t,i}) \cdot I_i \\
    & + S_r \sum_p \cdot\; S_{p,i} \cdot P_{p,i}(m \mid \vec{x_{p,i}}) \cdot T_{p,i}(t)
\Big]
\end{aligned}
$$

- $m$ is the mass
- $t$ is the transfer momentum
- $i$ is the wave index
- $\kappa$ is a constant kinematic factor. Expression hardcoded in `iftpwa/src/model/model_builder.py`, under development for GlueX. Currently just squared barrier factor.
- $S_b$ is the constant `bkg2res` factor scaling ALL background contributions (all waves) by the same amount
- $S_r$ is the constant `res2bkg` factor scaling ALL parametric contributions (all waves) by the same amount
- $\rho_i$ is the dictionary of constant phase space factors for the $i^{th}$ partial wave stored in a single pkl file, `phaseSpaceMultiplier`. Can be generated by `pa calc_ps` command
- $C_i$ is the overall scale factor for the $i^{th}$ partial wave. This is a random variable with half-normal / laplace priors. Without this, every amplitude should be O(1) scale, defined by `IFT_MODEL.scale`
- $G(s_i, f_i, a_i)$ is the Correlated field model with scale, flexibility, asperity, for the $i^{th}$ partial wave defined by `IFT_MODEL`. These parameters are random variables and are log-normal distributed. Mass and transfer momentum is factorized as a product of two correlated fields
- $I_i$ is the indicator function to zero the Correlated field component for a particular partial wave, indicated by `no_bkg` key in each resonance model. Useful if only want parameteric component in a specific wave
- $\sum_p$ sums over parametric components (multiple components can contribute to a single partial wave) defined by `PARAMETRIC_MODEL`
- $S_p$ is the constant `preScale` factor for the particular parametric component, $p$. Correlated field model at this point is roughly O(1) so this allows us to bias towards larger/smaller intensity from parameteric component
- $P(m \mid \vec{x_{p,i}})$ is the `PARAMETRIC_MODEL` component describing the mass dependence of the parameteric component with parameters $\vec{x_{p,i}}$ defined by `parameter_priors` (and also `static_paras`)
- $T(t)$ models the t-dependence for the Parameteric term. It can be another correlated field (with hardcoded power spectrum parameters) if `PARAMETRIC_MODEL.smoothScales` is true

```{note}
This amplitude description is for a single real/imaginary component of a particular partial wave. The correlated field parameters (defined as priors), $s_i, f_i, a_i$, are shared across all partial waves. This does not mean all the particular $s_i, f_i, a_i$ across partial waves are the same, as they are random variables. Though the real/imaginary components of a partial wave do share the same parameter values. 
```

## Default Configuration

We almost always would like to compare the IFT results to a set of maximum likelihood fits obtained using `AmpTools` so we need to perform two types of fits. A set of Maximum Likelihood (MLE) fits is performed using `AmpTools` and an Information Field Theory (IFT) fit is performed using `iftpwa`. Each has its own configuration file to specify the initial state. `PyAmpTools` will be the main driver of both these fits and has a YAML key that points to the `iftpwa` configuration file. Likewise, the `iftpwa` configuration file has a field that points to the `PyAmpTools` configuration file as it uses it to construct a `pwa_manager` object that calculates likelihoods.

There are two configuration files that one needs to manage.  We call them `pyamptools.yaml` and `iftpwa.yaml` but they can be anything. 
- `PyAmpTools` uses a configuration file to define the reaction, dataset locations, partial waves used, and kinematic binning
- `iftpwa` uses a configuration file but in this case to declare its IFT model, how to modify its likelihood (bootstrap, resampling, ...), and how to perform the IFT optimization.

Below are the default YAML configurations for GlueX analyses of $\gamma p \rightarrow \eta\pi^0 p$. This channel forms a basis for all **two pseudoscalar** channels as the partial wave basis is the same so the much of the general configuration is shared. 

```{note}
**Vector pseudoscalar** channels are also supported. The IFT model description remains the same and the associated default settings can work well. The only thing we have to consider is how to tell `PyAmpTools` how to generate the required `AmpTools` configuration file. See bottom of page for more information, which can also help other channels use `PyAmpTools` to generate a usable `AmpTools` configuration file. 
```

### PyAmpTools Configuration

`PyAmpTools` enforces a specific format for how to name amplitudes given some quantum numbers (stored as a dictionary in `pyamptools/src/utilities/general.py`). It also expects several files in the directory specfied in the `data_folder` YAML key with specific naming conventions also. This restriction allows `PyAmpTools` to bin the data sources and generate a configuration file for each bin that `AmpTools` can use. `iftpwa` can handle much finer kinematic bins than AmpTools due to the prior's regularization effect. To account for this, we split the data into fine bins, usable by `iftpwa`, then regroup the data bins into coarser bins for `AmpTools`.

```yaml
# Example data folder structure
accmc.root # shares this acceptance MC dataset for all polarizations
data000.root # data MC datasets for each polarization
data045.root # data MC datasets for each polarization
data090.root # data MC datasets for each polarization
data135.root # data MC datasets for each polarization
genmc.root # shares this generated/thrown MC dataset for all polarizations
bkgnd000.root # (optional) background MC datasets for each polarization
bkgnd045.root # (optional) background MC datasets for each polarization
bkgnd090.root # (optional) background MC datasets for each polarization
bkgnd135.root # (optional) background MC datasets for each polarization
```

```{note}
NIFTy results are regularized so it is able to handle finer kinematic binning than binned MLE fits. To bridge the two, we can initially bin finely then regroup nearby bins for AmpTools by specifying the `amptools.bins_per_group` key. This key must be a divisor of `n_mass_bins`. For the default settings below, we double the bins NIFTy sees over what AmpTools sees.

### IFTPWA Configuration

```{note}
NIFTy provides [Metric Gaussian Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11033) and [Geometric Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10470) methods for optimization. Both of these approaches alternate between optimizing the KL divergence for a specific shape of the variational posterior and updating the shape of the variational posterior, see [here](https://github.com/NIFTy-PPL/NIFTy?tab=readme-ov-file). A *global iteration* (see `nIterGlobal` key below) is complete when both optimization steps conclude. Some reshaping of the posterior is performed to make it more Gaussian-like for more effective inference.

# Scans are performed by [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna). 
# - iftpwa naturally tracks the likelihood energy and the intensity of all individual amplitude components. 
# - if a ground truth is provided, the mean squared error or chi-squared (if number of samples > 1) are also calculated. 
# Above metrics are all available to be optimized against. These metrics take the form `{amplitude_field_name}_{"fit", resonance_name, "bkg"}_{"intens", "chi2"}`. 
# - A list of tracked metrics can be dumped at the end of a iftpwa fit if `verbosityLevel` > 0 if you are unsure
# Aggregated stats for `chi2` metric is also calculated: `{min, -2sigma, -1sigma, median, 1sigma, 2sigma, max}` if available
# Fields within this yaml can be referenced following a field path that is period delimited. 
# An Optuna `suggest` command and associated args must also be passed. Field values must be a string that is then `eval`'d by `python` to construct `args` and `kwargs`. 
# - For example, `OPTIMIZATION.nSamples.1|suggest_int: "2, 10, step=2"` would modify the `nSamples` sub-field within the `OPTIMIZATION` field so that Optuna makes integer suggestions on list index element 1. The suggestions are integers between 2 and 10 in steps of 2. 
# - See Optuna docs for available `suggest` commands.

## Vector Pseudoscalar Channels

The IFT model description remains the same and the default settings can work well. The only thing we have to consider is how to tell `PyAmpTools` how to generate the required `AmpTools` configuration file and of course use a partial wave naming scheme that it can understand. Below is an example of for the $\gamma p \rightarrow \omega\eta p \rightarrow \eta \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0 p$ channel. 

Here we only highlight *some* specific keys that are different from the default
